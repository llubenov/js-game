   <h2> How to play </h2>
   The game is played by moving the players' rectangle by using - WASD keyboard buttons.

   <h2> About </h2>
   This game has been made as part of my university coursework for Client Side Graphics Programming for the Web Module.
   Main task was to create an interactive game using HTML5 and JavaScript. The idea of the game is to collect as many circles (points) as possible 
   before it starts getting really difficult to collect and the gravity starts increasing, which will make the player to start falling down and this will make
   it quite hard for the player to be collecting the circles. 
   </br>
   </br>
   </br>
   <h2> Resources </h2>
   There is two different sounds that I am using throughout the game, which are being played when the user is collecting the circles and is dying.
   Those sounds can be found <a href = "http://www.freesound.org/people/DrMinky/sounds/166184/">here</a> and <a href = "http://www.freesound.org/people/suntemple/sounds/253174/">here</a>.
   Apart from that, the rest of the code is my own work.
